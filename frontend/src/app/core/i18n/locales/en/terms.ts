  intro:
    'These Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”) govern access to and use of the Boletiva platform, a service for selling and validating tickets to events in Guatemala.

      paragraphs: [
        'Boletiva is a technology platform that lets event organizers (“promoters”) publish and sell tickets, and lets users (“buyers”) purchase, receive, transfer, and present them for validation at the event entrance.',
        'Boletiva acts as a technology intermediary between the promoter and the buyer. The promoter is solely responsible for the delivery, content, quality, dates, times, and conditions of the event. Boletiva does not organize events and does not guarantee that they will take place.',

        'Promoter: an authorized person or company that publishes an event and sells tickets through the platform.',
        'Ticket: the right to enter an event, represented by a dynamic digital code (QR) issued and signed by the platform.',
        'Wallet or internal balance: an account within the platform where refunds and credits in your favor are deposited; it cannot be topped up with a card.',
        'Service fee: a charge covering the platform’s commission and the payment gateway’s fee, shown itemized at checkout.',

        'To purchase tickets you must create an account with a valid email address and verify it. Verification is done with a 6-digit code or a magic link sent to your email.',
        'For your security, the platform requires a second authentication factor (2FA) —a code by email or an authenticator app— once your email is verified, especially when signing in from a new device. Trusted devices do not repeat 2FA.',
        'You are responsible for the accuracy of your information, for keeping your credentials confidential, and for all activity carried out from your account. You must have legal capacity to contract; minors may only use the platform through their legal representative.',

      paragraphs: [
        'All prices are shown in Guatemalan Quetzales (GTQ, Q) and include applicable Value Added Tax (VAT). The platform prominently shows an “all-in” price; the breakdown (ticket price + service fee + VAT) is presented at checkout with full transparency.',
        'The price you pay is always the single-payment (cash) price. If you choose to pay in installments with your card, no surcharge will be applied for that financing, in accordance with applicable Guatemalan regulations.',
        'A purchase is confirmed only when the payment is approved by the gateway. While you select seats, they are held temporarily for a limited time; if you do not complete payment within that window, the hold is released and the seats become available again.',
        'Available payment methods may include credit and debit cards and the internal balance (wallet). The price and its breakdown are always computed server-side; no amount sent by the browser is accepted as authoritative.',

        'As a general rule, ticket sales are final. Refund and exchange policies depend on each event and promoter; when they exist, they will be disclosed before purchase.',
        'If an event is canceled by the promoter, the corresponding refund policy will apply. When a refund is due, the amount will be credited to your internal balance (wallet) for use or withdrawal, unless the law or the event policy provides otherwise.',
        'In the event of a chargeback (a dispute filed with your issuing bank) or a refund, the associated ticket is invalidated immediately and the revocation is propagated to validation points, even offline. Improper use of chargebacks may result in suspension of your account.',

        'Each ticket has a maximum number of transfers, set by the event promoter. Every transfer is recorded in a tamper-evident, hash-chained log (chain of custody). Reselling for profit outside authorized channels is prohibited.',

        'The ticket is validated at the gate using a dynamic QR code that changes periodically. As a result, a screenshot or photo of the code does not work for entry: only the live ticket inside your account or wallet is valid.',
        'Validation works even without an internet connection at the access point, cryptographically verifying the ticket’s authenticity. Each ticket allows a single entry; a second attempt with the same ticket will be rejected.',

        'You may use your balance as a payment method (in full or in part) on your purchases, or request a withdrawal. Withdrawals are subject to approval and a processing fee that is disclosed before you confirm the request. All movements are recorded in a ledger with a tamper-evident trail.',

Boletiva charges a platform commission on sales and settles the corresponding net amount to the promoter, according to the agreed conditions and timelines.',
